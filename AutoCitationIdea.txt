Markdown/html file (index.md or maybe publication/index.md) has link to javascript file js/getCitations.
Javascript file searches through 'papers' folder, pulls the metatdata from each pdf, 
and creates a reference for each paper in markdown/html,
and adds this created markdown/html to publication.html.
Created html will have class references in each tag so that formatting can be controlled 
by an external CSS file
Publication.html file includes a reference to external css/styles.css file
styles.css includes definition of css classes, eg. class="reference-title" with the appropriate formatting
