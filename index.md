I'm interested in (and attempting to keep up with) life, the universe, and most things. I'm currently a senior researcher in the Department of Cognitive Science at Macquarie University but I'll be starting a new position as senior lecturer in the School of Psychological Science at the University of Western Australia in January 2020.

Broadly I'm interested in cognitive development and how an understanding of the mind can improve life outcomes and wellbeing. See the [About me](/aboutme.md) for more detail of my interests and background.

Please get in touch with me if you're interested in working with me or have any questions about my research or there's something that I might be able to assist you with.
