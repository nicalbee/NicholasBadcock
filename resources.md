## Somewhat Organised
Once upon a time I was helping a friend with some data wrangling. We sat down at the computer and just needed the data. "Maybe it's in My Documents... No. Maybe it's on the Desktop. No. ..." I decided to jot down a few habits of organising folders that I'd found useful. Some other ideas seemed relevant and this is where 'Somewhat Organised' came from.
